Computer Systems Engineering - Learning x86 Assembly and Creating a Linux Kernel 

This course expanded my minimal knowledge in x86 Assembly and Linux operating systems, and I learned advanced techniques and programming skills in Assembly through these first two MPs:

MP1 - Text Fish Animation

MP2 - Maze Game

The final project was done as a group, and it required us to develop a simple Linux operating system that includes support for non-preemptive context switching, segmented memory protection, a simple file system, and drivers for keyboard input, text output and clock.

MP3 - Linux Kernel and Operating System
